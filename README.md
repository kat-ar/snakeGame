## General info
This Snake game is based on freeCodeCamp.org tutorial made by Tech with Tim, available on youtube

## What I learned
I decided to recreate this code and add my own functionalities in order to start getting familiar with pygame library.

It is also my very first experience working with code someone else created - adding my own functionalities, repairing mistakes I found in someone else's work. It looks to me like working on a project someone abandoned before finishing it.

## Functionalities
* Added:
  - Main menu of sorts: Start (and restart) a game on key press
  - Display live score
  - Display current high score
* Currently I'm working on:
  - Scoreboard (high scores and nickname)
* Yet to be added:
  - Improve movements (pressing right-key disabled when snake is moving left etc)
  - Choosing snake colour

## Technologies
Project is created with
* Python 3.11.0
* Pygame 2.1.2
* Tkinter 8.6
